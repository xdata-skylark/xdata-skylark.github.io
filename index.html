<p>The Skylark library supplies sketching-based Numerical Linear Algebra (NLA) 
kernels for general statistical data analysis and optimization applications.</p>

<p>Many tasks in machine learning and statistics ultimately end up being problems 
involving matrices: whether you're finding the key players in the bitcoin market, 
or inferring where tweets came from, or figuring out what's in sewage, you'll want 
to have a toolkit for least-squares and robust regression, eigenvector analysis, 
non-negative matrix factorization, and other matrix computations.</p>

<p><i>Sketching</i> is a way to compress matrices that preserves key matrix properties; 
it can be used to speed up many matrix computations. Sketching takes a given matrix A and 
produces a sketch matrix B that has fewer rows and/or columns than A. For a good sketch B, 
if we solve a problem with input B, the solution will also be pretty good for input A. 
For some problems, sketches can also be used to get faster ways to find high-precision 
solutions to the original problem.</p>

<p>A simple example of sketching is just sampling the rows (and/or columns) of the matrix, 
where each row (and/or column) is equally likely to be sampled. This uniform sampling is 
quick and easy, but doesn't always yield good sketches; however, there are sophisticated 
sampling methods that do yield good sketches.</p>

<p>This project is building a sketching-based open-source software stack for NLA and its 
applications.</p>

<p>Additionally this library provides a simple distributed Python interface.</p>
